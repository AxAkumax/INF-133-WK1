Personal Portfolio
Name: Akshita Akumalla 

Total Points Completed: I believe I have completed 13  assignment points for this assignment (maybe more for the spirit?), meeting the minimum criteria of 3 HTML content, 2 CSS Styling, and 1 advanced feature along with passing the validation checks for all the files. 

Clarification: For the index html valid accessibility check, I received 1 contrast error (no critical errors) and I think it is due to the animation that I used to type out my introduction when the page loads. I utilized a typing animation that blends all the letters to the background and changes each letter to a darker color as the cursor crosses it (border-right property). However, after the animation is complete, I ensured to add a property that keeps the darker colored text set on the lighter background after the animation is done to not cause any issues for the user in terms of readability. 

Content Breakdown:
1) HTML Content (3 min): I utilized appropriate headings and paragraphs in my "About" section along with "Projects". I have added links to external pages for my GitHub account in "Projects" and my LinkedIn in "Contact" along with including links to all the pages on the website. I utilized a total of 5 pages including the home page and used a navigation bar with 5 buttons (linked) that give access to each page on the top of the screen. I also used semantic HTML tags such as a footer for each page with my name that had the copyright logo along with tags such as "section" in my About section (in addition to a header that had all the navigation buttons for the other pages). Lastly, I also used images with a descriptive alt attribute in my "Projects" section to describe the images I had provided (text editor, half-completed sudoku board, and Air Quality Index scale).
2) CSS Styling (2 min): I have modified the margins and padding for each webpage to fit the layout even in certain div containers to enhance certain sections. I have modified links for all my buttons and changed the text color, font size and type, and background color using a color palette that has a theme of brown and beige throughout the website to fit the aesthetic of my portfolio.
3) Advanced Feature (1 min): I added a contact form in my "Contact" page that collects the user's name, email, and a message that they might have for me. I also included a complex page layout with my navigation bar that includes access to all the other web pages at the top and stays consistent with all the webpages in the website to create a professional normal and I also changed the hyperlinks of the linked buttons to feel more like a button and less like clicking on a link.

Lastly, I also utilized CSS animations with key-frames that may be applied to one of the sections above with my introduction and photo on my homepage.

Time: This assignment took me a total of 18-19 hours for 4-5 days (including learning new material and changing and adjusting content as I made the website, sometimes having to also restart on a new idea).
