    <p class = "text" style="line-height: 1.6vw;"> Hello! I'm Akshita Akumalla, a third-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Irvine. A little bit about me: I love to code and enjoy solving problems and building fun projects. I currently work as a Coding Instructor at Coding Minds Academy, teaching classes in programming and Web development. I have taken courses in AI, Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Data Management, System Design, etc. I hope to leverage my knowledge and skills into Software Engineering and Full-Stack/Backend Development.</p>

    <h2> My Journey into Computer Science </h2>
    <section>
      <p> &ensp;&ensp;My journey into Computer Science was unexpected. As a high school freshman, I walked into a robotics club for the first time to accompany a friend, and little did I know that this one visit would change the course of my career. <br><br> &ensp;&ensp; Other than knowing how to work Microsoft Word, the idea of computers or anything relating to it felt so foreign. While the robotics club had fun activities, I needed to catch up on the necessary skills to participate in them. The imposter syndrome hits. Should I bother trying something new when I know nothing about it? I asked myself this question many times. But the truth is, anyone who is good at anything once started as a beginner, and in my situation, while my peers knew more, it doesn't mean that I am too late. We are never too late to learn anything. Hence, I decided to give my best shot. I'm glad I did.</p>

        <p style="padding-bottom: 1.5vw;"> &ensp;&ensp;From starting as a beginner, I picked up Ch (a modified C language) and took courses related to Computer Science, where I learned HTML and Java. I joined organizations such as Girls Who Code, where I served as a board member and gained valuable insight into the different paths one can pursue in the field. Before I knew it, I was a senior graduating high school as the President of the Linkbot Robotics club, and computer science never felt more exciting. <br> <br> &ensp;&ensp;College came with its challenges with classes and the uncertainty of what I wanted to do with my major. After taking the notoriously "challenging" courses, I realized what I loved most about this field: imagination. The creative process in problem-solving pushes me to think outside the box. It was about writing code that not only works but is also efficient in meeting the necessary constraints while being readable to others. It challenges you to think of innovative ways to build solutions. Being a part of this process is not just exciting but also rewarding. <br><br>&ensp;&ensp;The rush of adrenaline you get when your program starts to work is an understated feeling. The joy and satisfaction encompasses not just the program's success but also the growth it took to get there. With these experiences, Computer Science just felt like the right fit for me, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it takes me!  </p>
